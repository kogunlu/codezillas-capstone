      At Healing, we believe there is a better way to do things. A more valuable way where customers are earned rather than bought. We\`re obsessively passionate about it, and our mission is to help people achieve it. We focus on search engine optimization. It\`s one of the least understood and least transparent aspects of great marketing, and we see that as an opportunity. We\`re excited to simplify SEO for everyone through our software, education, and community.

        Our Founding
      </h1>

        className="text-gray-800 2xl:text-xl"

        Healing was founded by Payam Abubakr in 2021. It was called Healing Online, and started as a blog and an online community where some of the world\`s therapists shared their research and ideas. We launched the Beginner\`s Guide to Therapy and our first study, and that hub of industry expertise transformed into a small consulting firm and led us to create the Online Therapist of today!
